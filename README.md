# Project Happy Thoughts
I've created an app that allows user to write and share happy-thoughts: The thoughts can me "liked" by clicking a button.

## The challenge
The assignment required use of both fetching API -to POST and GET "thoughts" + "likes" and make them update onclick.

I created different components to structure the code and make it more readable- Linked them togetherÂ¨with import/export.

If I had more time, I would style it more and add more features.
