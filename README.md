# ❤️ Happy Thoughts ❤️

Project making a app to make users able to share thoughts, almost like a Twitter-clone, with React components and useState/useEffect.
I've created an app that allows user to write and share happy-thoughts: The thoughts can me "liked" by clicking a button.
I created different components to structure the code and make it more readable- Linked them together¨with import/export.

## The challenge
This project has been made using: HTML5, CSS3, React (useEffect, useState, props, form validation etc)

Fetched data from API, with both GET and POST request. 
I created different components to structure the code and make it more readable- Linked them together¨with import/export.
